# Clarifai RAG System Setup

This guide explains how to set up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the Clarifai Python SDK in just a few steps. 

## Step 1: Installation and Setup

First, install the required packages and set your Clarifai Personal Access Token (PAT) as an environment variable.

1. **Install Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install clarifai llama-index
    ```

2. **Set Your Clarifai PAT:**
    - Sign up for the platform at [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com).
    - Access your PAT at [Clarifai Security Settings](https://clarifai.com/settings/security).
    - Set the PAT as an environment variable:
      ```bash
      export CLARIFAI_PAT=your_personal_access_token
      ```

## Step 2: Import and Setup RAG

Next, import the RAG class and configure the RAG system with your Clarifai user ID and the Gemini-1.5 Flash model URL from the Clarifai community.

1. **Find the Gemini-1.5 Flash model URL:** [Gemini-1.5 Flash Model](http://clarifai.com/gcp/generate/models/gemini-1_5-flash).
2. **Find your Clarifai User ID:** [Clarifai User ID](https://clarifai.com/settings/security).

3. **Set up the RAG System:**
    ```python
    from clarifai import RAG

    user_id = 'your_clarifai_user_id'
    model_url = 'http://clarifai.com/gcp/generate/models/gemini-1_5-flash'

    rag = RAG(user_id=user_id, model_url=model_url)
    ```

## Step 3: Upload Data

Upload the data you want to use with the RAG system. In this example, we upload a PDF file of a research paper. Once uploaded, the data will be embedded and indexed into your Clarifai app, which acts as your vector database.

```python
pdf_file_path = 'path_to_your_research_paper.pdf'
rag.upload_data(pdf_file_path)
```

## Step 4: Chat with Your Data

Once the data has been ingested into the app, you can chat with it. For example, you can ask the system to summarize the PDF file.

```python
response = rag.chat("Summarize the PDF file")
print(response)
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You've successfully set up a RAG system using the Clarifai Python SDK.
